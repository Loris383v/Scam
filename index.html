    <h1>You just got scammed</h1>
    <p>Luckily for you, this was just to show how easily you can be tricked, so this wasn't a real scam. But if it had been, you might've lost your data, your account, or even your money.</p>
    <p>This page is here to remind you something simple: <strong>Always double-check links</strong> before clicking, and <strong>never</strong> click suspicious links. Scammers are everywhere, and they're counting on you being careless. Your presence on this page proves you are a potential target</p>
    <p>Don't trust random links. Don't enter your passwords unless you're sure the site is legit. Stay skeptical. Stay smart.</p>
    <h3 class="warning">Next time, it could be real.</h3>
